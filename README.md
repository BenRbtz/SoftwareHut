An Android app create by Jac Robertson and I in our 2nd year in University.
Written in Java and MongoDb.Â 
The app was an assignment in University to centralised tasks a farmer would do to a day-to-day bases in a single app.

My contribution to the app was:
- Coded two form pages to send to a database.
- Coded a MongoDb back-end to an external database.
- Coded a To-do list page.
- Connected the homepage to both forms pages and the To-do list.


Jacs contribution to the app was:
- Code weather page.
- Code a calender page.
- Connect the homepage to both Weather and Calender pages.
